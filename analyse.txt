Effects of command line variables:
Networking
-n  enable networking
sdl_com_line.networking
Not checked if SIOCGIFHWADDR not defined

Memory
-R  enable reading from shared memory
sdl_com_line.rsz81mem 
-W  enable writing to shared memory
sdl_com_line.wsz81mem

Attempt compilation with:
PART sdl_main.c Clone - Has main and dispay
YES common.c
YES sound.c But initially do not define OSS_SOUND_SUPPORT 
YES zx81config.c 
NO w5100.c No - networking, need to remove dependence
PART sdl_engine.c Need parts
NO sdl_hotspots.c
NO sdl_input.c Mainly for dialogs and virtual keybaord
Yes sdl_loadsave.c Fairly self contained - general file handling
NO sdl_resources.c Contains icons, virtual keyboard etc Will need to handle directories
No sdl_sound.c Need to translate into pico interrupt
NO sdl_video.c 
YES z80/z80.c 
YES z80/z80_ops.c (includes rest of op codes)
YES zx81.c 
? dissz80.c Do we need a disassembler?
? tables.c Part of dZ80
? noscript.c to fake dissz80p

Needs simple repeating 10ms timer
Created by emulator_timer in sdl_engine.c

Rules
#define ZXPICO for all changes
Keep SZ81 defined, initially undefine OSS_SOUND_SUPPORT
All changes and additions within
#ifdef ZXPICO or #ifndef ZXPICO
no deletes
Disable Chroma, Network and shard memory through #ifndef ZXPICO
move to CMake and create CMakeList.txt
